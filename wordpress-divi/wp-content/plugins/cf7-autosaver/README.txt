Auto-save selected Contact Form 7 and Auto-fill them by Facebook!

== Description ==

This is a simple addon plugin for the Contact form 7 plugin that allows you to do 2 things:

1. Select some forms to enable auto-save on them, meaning when a user fill the form, without even submitting it, then navigates to another page and comes back or refreshes the page, they will see the data they previously filled still available for them!
1. Select some forms to enable "Fill with Facebook" feature for them, this will automatically insert a link to the contact form 7 selected that when a user clicks, it allows them to authenticate their Facebook profile and automatically fill the form fields once they authenticate!

The plugin comes with a nice WordPress admin's dashboard settings page and is very easy to use!
